# Summary Statement

This dissertation is centrally concerned with exploring obituaries as repositories of values. It seeks to lay a foundation for detecting values, defined from the Schwartz values model [e.g., @schwartz_overview_2012], in obituaries, and to examine their relation to characteristics of the individuals described in those obituaries, and to their communities. Obituaries are a publicly-available natural language source that are variably written for members of communities that are wide (nation-level) and narrow (city-level, or at the level of specific groups therein). Because they are explicitly summative, limited in size, and written for consumption by a public audience, obituaries may be expected to express concisely the aspects of their subjects' lives that the authors (often family members living in the same communities) found most salient or worthy of featuring.

This study of values using a natural language approach with obituaries fundamentally takes a descriptive rather than normative stance. However, this dissertation is founded in the idea that descriptive research into values can provide insight into the normative makeup of the communities that espouse them and, potentially, can allow useful relationships to be seen about the communities and the individuals that they comprise (in this project, the obituaries' subjects). As, to some extent, rituals of praise, obituaries specifically can offer a route to understanding the values of the communities that write them.

# Background on the Schwartz Values model

The Schwartz values paradigm [e.g., @schwartz_overview_2012] is widely cited[^footnoteOnSchwartzBeingWidelyCited] in the values literature for its wide scope and a substantial body of evidence demonstrating its ability to describe value priorities across cultures and social groups therein. As Schwartz (2012) summarized, the model posits that 10 basic categories reliably encompass differences in values across cultures. The model defines values "as desirable, transsituational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in people's lives" [@schwartz_extending_2001, p. 521]. Thus, in the model, value-categories are primarily differentiated by the "[primary end-]goal[s] or motivation[s]" toward which they are oriented [@schwartz_overview_2012, p. 4; @schwartz_extending_2001][^footnoteOnSchwartzAlignmentWithHaybronAndTiberius].

[^footnoteOnSchwartzBeingWidelyCited]: As of September, 2016, Google Scholar recorded that @schwartz_universals_1992 has been cited 12,544 times.

[^footnoteOnSchwartzAlignmentWithHaybronAndTiberius]: Schwartz' conceptualization of values is in line with that of @haybron_normative_2012 [p. 9], who defined values as "relatively robust pro-attitudes [i.e., attitudes in favor of certain actions], or clusters of pro-attitudes, that we take to generate reasons for action and furnish standards for evaluating how our lives are going."

    <!-- This is indented to mark that it is a new paragraph of the footnote above. -->@schwartz_universals_1992 [p. 4]Â further defined values as "(1) concepts or beliefs [that] (2) pertain to desirable end states or behaviors, (3) transcend specific situations, (4) guide selection or evaluation of behavior and events, and (5) are ordered by relative importance." This definition agrees with Haybron and Tiberius' [-@haybron_normative_2012] at least in its second and fourth parts. To Haybron and Tiberius, values go beyond short-term preferences in generating impulses to action, to some extent becoming ends for action in themselves in a way that preferences do not (Haybron and Tiberius noted that values can be called "subjectively reason-grounding" in that they are used by individuals to justify actions even when no good or otherwise justifiable reasons for those actions exist).


Graphical depictions of the model often arrange the value categories circularly, conceptually allowing pairs of given categories to be complementary or in opposition to one another, and to represent that they are more continuously than rigidly defined[^footnoteOnFigureOfSchwartzCircumplexModel]. The approximate quadrants of this circle can also be named [All quotes below are from @schwartz_overview_2012, p. 5-9; the list below moves around the image of the circular model presented by @schwartz_overview_2012 in a counter-clockwise direction]:

1. Openness to change
	1. *Self-Direction* ("Defining goal: independent thought and action--choosing, creating, exploring.")
	2. *Stimulation* ("Defining goal: excitement, novelty, and challenge in life.")
	3. *Hedonism* ("Defining goal: pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself.")
2. Self-Enhancement
	1. *Hedonism* (Also above, in Openness to change)
	2. *Achievement* ("Defining goal: personal success through demonstrating competence according to social standards.")
	3. *Power* ("Defining goal: social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources.")
3. Conservation
	1. *Security* ("Defining goal: safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self.")
	2. *Conformity* ("Defining goal: restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms.")
	3. *Tradition* ("Defining goal: respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that one's culture or religion provides.")
4. Self-Transcendence
	1. *Benevolence* ("Defining goal: preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact \[the 'in-group'].)"
	2. *Universalism* ("Defining goal: understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and for nature.")

While, @schwartz_overview_2012 noted, the model does posit (and has accumulated a large body of evidence for) 10 distinct values, the value-categories may more usefully be thought of as pragmatically-defined boundaries along a continuum. Thus, Schwartz argued, the value categories can be expected to blend into one another, and can reasonably be subdivided (or superdivided) depending on the goals of a particular project. Further, measures that assess values as defined in the model seek to allow interpretation of "priorities" from among the value categories, rather than of raw scores [@schwartz_overview_2012, p. 12; cf. @schwartz_extending_2001]. With this in mind, this dissertation project examines *relative* relationships among texts in a corpus in the values that they express, and seeks to avoid taking an absolute approach (e.g., $x$ text is linguistically closer / expresses value $y$ to a greater extent than value $z$," vs. "$x$ text is about $y$ value").
