The current project explored the extent to which a sample of contemporary obituaries from across the USA used words related to values from Schwartz' [e.g., -@schwartz_overview_2012] model. To do this, it employed word-by-hop, a new measure of lexical distance from a given set of target words and the Schwartz values they indicate. Obituaries were expected to be a particularly useful potential repository of values when viewed in aggregate, as, given their place in death-related ritual in the USA, they could be expected to be particularly charged with value-expressions (even if only of a positive valence), more so than general newspaper texts [such as those used by @bardi_new_2008] or other public corpora.

Blah blah blah...
