abstract="The power scaling challenge associated with Exascale systems is a
well-known issue. In this work, we introduce the Global Extensible Open Power
Manager (GEOPM): a tree-hierarchical, open source runtime framework we are
contributing to the HPC community to foster increased collaboration and
accelerated progress toward software-hardware co-designed energy management
solutions that address Exascale power challenges and improve performance and
energy efficiency in current systems. Through its plugin extensible
architecture, GEOPM enables rapid prototyping of new energy management
strategies. Different plugins can be tailored to the specific performance or
energy efficiency priorities of each HPC center. To demonstrate the potential
of the framework, this work develops an example plugin for GEOPM. This power
rebalancing plugin targets power-capped systems and improves efficiency by
minimizing job time-to-solution within a power budget. Our results demonstrate
upÂ to 30{\%} improvements in the time-to-solution of CORAL system procurement
benchmarks on a Xeon Phi cluster.",

abstract="Performance measurement of parallel algorithms is well studied and
well understood. However, a flaw in traditional performance metrics is that
they rely on comparisons to serial performance with the same input. This
comparison is convenient for theoretical complexity analysis but impossible to
perform in large-scale empirical studies with data sizes far too large to run
on a single serial computer. Consequently, scaling studies currently rely on ad
hoc methods that, although effective, have no grounded mathematical models. In
this position paper we advocate using a rate-based model that has a concrete
meaning relative to speedup and efficiency and that can be used to unify strong
and weak scaling studies.",
