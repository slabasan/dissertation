Power consumption is widely regarded as one of the biggest challenges to
reaching the next generation of high performance computing (HPC).
%
On future supercomputers, power will be a limited resource.
%
This constraint will affect the performance of both simulation and
visualization workloads.
%
Understanding how a particular application behaves under a power limit is
critical to making better use of the limited power.
%
In this research, we focus specifically on visualization and analysis applications,
which are an important component in HPC.
%
Visualization algorithms merit special consideration, since they are more
data intensive in nature than traditional HPC programs, such as simulation
codes.
%
We explore the power and performance tradeoffs for several common algorithms
under different configurations, and understand how power constraints will
affect execution behaviors.
%
We then demonstrate that we can gain additional performance by redistributing
power based on performance predictions provided by the visualization algorithm.
